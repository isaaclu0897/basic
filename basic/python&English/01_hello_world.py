Python is a clean and powerful programing language,

you can use it to do many thing,

I also analyze data, and write the web crawler,

they can help you to learn programe fast,

please believe it
'''

print("Hello World")

# this is very easy to print, you don't need to add semicolon(分號) like C, Java etc.

# Hello World between the two double quote, let the Python know this is sting
